Data Analysis: Cyberslacking and Increased Security Risk

Objective:
Create a data analysis report to understand the correlation between employee attitudes towards cyberslacking and perceived increased security risks in the workplace.

Data Structure:
Strongly Agree = 1
Agree = 2
Neither agree nor disagree = 3
Disagree = 4
Strongly Disagree = 5

Dependent Value = 

Cyberslacking	
Increased Security Risk


Tasks:

Summarize the central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, range) of responses for both variables.
Perform hypothesis testing to check if negative attitudes towards cyberslacking (disagreeing with the concept) are associated with a perception of higher security risks.
Create scatter plots and calculate Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient between the two variables to explore the relationship visually and statistically.
Provide a regression analysis model to predict the impact of attitudes towards cyberslacking on perceived security risks.
Expected Deliverables:

A comprehensive report detailing the statistical summaries, hypothesis test results, correlation coefficients, and regression analysis.
Visuals including histograms for each variable and scatter plot for the relationship analysis.
Conclusions based on the statistical findings and their implications for workplace policies.
